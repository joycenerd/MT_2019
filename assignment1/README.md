## Introduction

Given 2 to 3 images try and using purely coding to compose the images into one resulting image. The best composition is when the resulting image looks as natural as possible.

## Technologies

Prequisite:

*  MATLAB: recommended version R2019b

## Setup

1. Open MATLAB
2. select **~/MT_2019/assignment1** as the open folder
3. Open **image_comp.m**, **my_comp1.m**, **my_comp2.m**
4. You can execute the program by clicking run on the top bar
5. All the output will be in the folder **"./output"**

## Result

All the result can be seen in **"./output"** folder

The result of **image_comp.m** is the following image

![sample](./img_for_report/sample.png)

The result of **my_comp1.m** is the following image

![my composition 1](./img_for_report/my_composition_1.png)

The result of **my_comp_2.m** is the following image

![my composition 2](./img_for_report/my_composition_2.png)
